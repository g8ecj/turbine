The software allows the logging of the following items:

   Date
   Time
   Temperature
   Battery charge
   Battery volts
   Charge/discharge current
   Shunt % load
   Power
   Turbine RPM
   Maximum and minimum power in the last hour and day
   Event flags (inverter on/off etc)

The record generated looks like this:

The User Interface.

There are 5 buttons. Up, Down, Left, Right and Centre

At startup, the monitor screens are displayed in a carousel with an interval of about 5 seconds.
Press Centre to cancel the carousel or press Up/Down to move between monitor screens
Press Left/Right to move between setup screens.
When on a setup screen, press Centre to enter screen edit mode. This allows the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to move between the fields on the screen.
When in screen edit mode, press both Left and Right together to get back to moving between screens or press Centre to get to field edit mode.
When in field edit mode, Up/Down change the value. Some values have intellegent increments (eg. if over 100 then move in 10's, if over 1000 then 100's).
When in field edit mode, Left aborts any changes, Right sets the default for this field and Centre saves the value.
Some fields also have extra facilities, such as calibrate - this not only changes the scaling factor to allow the voltage measurement to track, it
also runs the 1-wire auto zero algorithm on the current sensor. For this reason the calibration must be done with no load or charging occuring.
