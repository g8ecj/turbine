The software allows the logging of the following items:

   Date
   Time
   Temperature
   Battery charge
   Battery volts
   Charge/discharge current
   Shunt % load
   Power
   Turbine RPM
   Maximum and minimum power in the last hour and day
   Event flags (inverter on/off etc)

The record generated looks like this:

There are 5 buttons. Up, Down, Left, Right and Centre

At startup, the monitor screens are displayed in a carousel with an interval of about 5 seconds.
Press Centre to cancel the carousel or press Up/Down to move between monitor screens
Press Left/Right to move between setup screens.
When on a setup screen, press Centre to enter screen edit mode. This allows the Up/Down/Left/Right keys to move between the fields on the screen.
When in screen edit mode, press both Left and Right together to get back to moving between screens or press Centre to get to field edit mode.
When in field edit mode, Up/Down change the value. Some values have intellegent increments (eg. if over 100 then move in 10's, if over 1000 then 100's).
When in field edit mode, Left aborts any changes, Right sets the default for this field and Centre saves the value.
Some fields also have extra facilities, such as calibrate - this not only changes the scaling factor to allow the voltage measurement to track, it
also runs the 1-wire auto zero algorithm on the current sensor. For this reason the calibration must be done with no load or charging occuring.


A few general notes:

The controller relies on charge counting to see what the level of charge is in the batteries. This requires that the user manually synchronises 
the controller with the batteries from time to time. A couple of methods are used to try and keep the charge tracking accurate.

    The leakage (self discharge) can be programmed by the number of days for 1% discharge. The default is 7 days. 
    During a discharge, the charge recorded is adjusted by the ratio of the total charge/discharge tracking registers. eg if the totals registers 
    show a 92% efficiency then a 100amp hr discharge will be recorded as 108 amp-hrs to account for the cyclic losses. 


The charging control is based on a 3 stage charge such that

    Less than 90% in the batteries then bulk charge where the shunt load is only operated if the Max voltage is exceeded.
    90% to 100% in the batteries then absorb mode is used where the shunt load starts to come in at float voltage but clamps to the absorb voltage max.
    100% in the batteries and float mode is used where the voltage is clamped to between 99% and 100% of the float voltage by the shunt load.
    The voltage is temperature compensated at a rate of 5mV per degree Celsius.


The shunt load is a PWM output at about 900Hz with opto isolators which in my case drives 4 automotive 160amp MOSFETS in parallel, although the load 
itself is only 40amps so far!!

The SD card operations all try and minimise the chance of data corruption. Generally the card is written to once a minute so if the card is popped 
out then hopefully its not in the middle of a data write!! When its put back in then the sense line is used to re-open the current log file (or a 
new one is created if there isn't one).

The next instalment is the serial interface. I run this via a wireless router (a TPLink 1043ND) that runs OpenWRT software and has the ACM driver 
loaded. I can ssh into the router and run picocom to get log info back from the controller or I can even reprogram it using the following command 
line on the router:
  socat tcp-l:54321,reuseaddr,fork file:/dev/ttyACM0,raw,echo=0,nonblock,waitlock=/var/run/tty0.lock,b115200
and the following line on my server/development box
  avrdude -p atmega2560 -c stk500v2 -P net:tplink:54321  -U flash:w:images/ardmega-turbine.hex

Here is the (very basic) help output

>> ?

>>del dir type disk dcs inv log date time find config<<


The first few commands are associated with the storage of data on the SD card. I've used command name familiar with DOS/Windows users rather than 
my preferred Linux (Unix) names!!

del - delete a file
dir - directory listing
type - display a file (end early with ESC)
disk - disk info, such as SD card manufacturer, free space, space used
dcs - this initialises the dis/charge registers to allow the total charge going in and out of the battery bank to be tracked. The ratio of these 
      values is also used to determine the charge cycle efficiency.
inv - toggle the invert on or off
log - toggle the logging on/off. Handy if you don't want a display messed up with a log line in the middle of it
date - set the date as dd/mm/yy
time - set the time as hh:mm:ss. The date & time get lost on a restart as the Arduino has no real time clock. The values do get saved to EEPROM 
       once per hour so at least any adjustments aren't too onerous!
find - like type but it only outputs lines that contain the string defined (cf. Unix grep). The number of days to look back by can be defined 
       with a minus sign. eg. "find -3 F:10" will look over the past 3 days to find log entries where a new hourly maximum power was logged (the flag 
       value of 10 means that!!).
config - displays some of the config.

The log info is stored in a FAT32 file system, one file per day.
